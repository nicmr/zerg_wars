# zerg_wars
A game AI experiment about two zerg tribes fighting for control over a planet / local 1v1 / 1vAI / AIvAI.

Built on top of ggez.



## How to build
It's currently still impossible to build, as it needs to fetch some sprite assets that are not part of this github repository.

In the next few days, changes that allow the game to download the required assets on its own will be commited.

Once the commit is up, it will be as easy as running 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nicmr/zerg_wars.git
cd zerg_wars
cargo run --release
```
